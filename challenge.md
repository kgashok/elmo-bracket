### The Elmo-Bracket Challenge 
![Elmo](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/e2/1e/1a/e21e1aae68defaefe5d35216740586df.jpg) 

The latest Bracket Validator is now updated at http://bracket.kgisl.com 

1. The stack object grows interactively as it handles brackets in the input string
2. The mismatch (versus) imbalanced conditions are differentiated 

This will also come in handy as a teaching tool to convey 
  - Objects (a stack and a map make up a validator)
  - "Dynamic" nature can be touched and felt by the student directly 

#### A MINI PROJECT CHALLENGE
`Stage 1` : Mimic an equivalent functionality using any technology stack 
`Stage 2` : Extend this project to become an `Infix to Postfix Expression` Evaluator 

Faculty and student groups are both eligible for this. They can use whatever technology stack they prefer  

1. Using Elm - Most preferable (probably the longest learning curve)
2. Using Javascript ReactJS - 2nd preference
3. Any other (including PHP)
