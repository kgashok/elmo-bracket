The latest Bracket Validator is now updated at http://bracket.kgisl.com 

1. The stack object grows interactively as it handles brackets in the input string
2. The mismatch (versus) imbalanced conditions are differentiated 

This will also come in handy as a teaching tool to convey 
  - Objects (a stack and a map make up a validator)
  - "Dynamic" nature can be touched and felt by the student directly

# To Do 
Look at the [ToDo.md](ToDo.md) file.

#### A MINI PROJECT CHALLENGE
`Stage 1` : Mimic an equivalent functionality using any technology stack   
`Stage 2` : Extend this project to become an `Infix to Postfix Expression` Evaluator    
`Stage 3` : Can the styling be improved to make it more intuitive? Storing intermediary results?  

Faculty and student groups are both eligible for this. They can use whatever technology stack they prefer  

1. Using Elm - Most preferable (probably the longest learning curve)
2. Using Javascript ReactJS - 2nd preference
3. Any other (including PHP)
