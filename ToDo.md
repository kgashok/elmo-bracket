## ToDo

###Testing
- Add unit testing framework from https://github.com/deadfoxygrandpa/elm-test
	- Rudimentary testing of `initialModel` length
	- `validate` function tests added - here's a [snapshot](img/unitTests.png).
	- Must attempt BDD style testing as well 


### Continuous Deployment
- Continuous integration and deployment to be setup on Heroku
	- Why not deploy Bracket to github.io? How can this be done? 

### Misc
- Refactor indexing characters using [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37281332/elm-code-for-splitting-a-string-into-list-of-tuples-containing-character-and-its/37281604#37281604)
  - Sample code available [here](markdown/indexedCharacters.elm.md)
- Hover over text to indicate how Validator is composed of by a Stack and a Map
